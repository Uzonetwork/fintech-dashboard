Case Study: Why json-server?

To make the project easy to run, I used json-server to mock API endpoints for transactions and login.
This avoids backend setup complexity while still showing how I handle:

API calls

Authentication flow

State management

It keeps the project lightweight, portable, and user-friendly.
